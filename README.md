# Getting Started

1. To setup this project, create a virtual environment using Python 3.6 or higher and run the following command in your terminal (ensure that you are in the project directory):
    ```bash
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   <p>It will set your environment up to run the project</p>

2. Run the following commands in your terminal:
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver
    ```  

    This will set your SQL database up and run your local server.
    Press ```ctrl+c``` to stop the server.

3.  You will find a directory named `Main` in the root directory of the project, most of your code should go there.

4.  Do remember to run ```python manage.py makemigrations``` in your terminal before committing changes.
